# Meteor - Apollo GraphQL - Vue setup

This follows along [Scott's Full-stack GraphQL course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFTDL9M1PKnxQwBwOZ8J-h4)
and is meant for people that want to learn Meteor, Apollo and GraphQL with that series, but would rather do it with vue on the Vue front-end instead of React.  

We creates a basic resolutions app with sub-tasks called goals, each with a completed status, also authentication and some reactivity.

We do Queries, Mutations, custom Resolvers and leverage Meteor's Mongo client to interact with the database.

Enjoy.
